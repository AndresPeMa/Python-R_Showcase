# Python-R_Showcase
This repository encompasses a collection of compact projects and assignments, each exemplifying my competence in markdown, data science, and data analysis, as well as R and Python programming. These scripts were crafted during my time pursuing a Master of Science in Quantitative Economics at Cal Poly SLO, attesting to my skill development across diverse domains.
