# Python-R_Showcase
This repository encompasses a collection of compact projects and assignments, each exemplifying my competence in markdown, data science, data analysis, and R and Python programming. These scripts were written while pursuing a Master of Science in Quantitative Economics at Cal Poly SLO, attesting to my skill development across diverse domains.


<b>Files </b> 
  1) "Bond yields and sell your soul to the Devil"
  2) "Discrete version of McCall and three-period optimization"
  3) "Dynamic Programming with Markov Matrices"
  4) "Economic Effects of a Year-Long Lockdown"
  5) "Multiplier-accelerator Model; Kernel Estimation Assignment"
  6) "Parking Problem and Eating a Magic Cake"
  7) "Practice With Macro Data Assignment"
  8) "Solow Model"
  9) "Working with Markov Chains". 

are all done in Python and are part of a Dynamic Stochastic Modeling class I took during the winter quarter of 2023 in which we went over finite Markov chains, linear state space models, dynamic programming, rational expectations equilibrium, Markov perfect equilibrium, Stackelberg plans, general equilibrium under certainty and uncertainty, Arrow securities, consumption-based asset pricing, incomplete markets.

<b>Files </b>
1) Rmarkdown-Code-Replication--2
2) Rmarkdown-Code-Replication--6
3) Rmarkdown-Code-Replication-9

are all done in R and are part of an Advanced Econometrics I class I took during the fall quarter of 2022 in which we learned R and went over the linear regression model, confidence and prediction intervals, hypothesis testing, the generalized regression model, and heteroscedasticity, identification and causal inference: randomization, regression, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, differences in differences.


<b>Files </b>
1) Data mess around
2) Descriptive Stats
3) merging_ethiopia_and_mars

are all done in R and are part of the project collaboration with the World Bank Organization. The scripts show data validation used to get an ultimate dataset with all variables of interest and proceed to train and compare machine learning models. 

It is important to note that many of these scripts were collaborative group projects or assignments completed through collective efforts.
